# TotallySaf-3pm
Just a fun example of unitrix style for testing. It builds an executable that looks like an MP3 file because it reverses the last 7 characters from "3pm.exe" to "exe.mp3".

Grab a release binary and see if it makes it through file uploads to become an epic fake Trojan. Or fork it and add your own payloads.

Since a bunch of people were scared of the .zip TLD I created [https://totallysafexe.zip](https://totallysafexe.zip) which servs up totallysafexe.zip. You can see how some browsers remove the unicode char, but it may be interesting to see which ones dont.
